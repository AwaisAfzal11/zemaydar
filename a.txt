README
This project is a JavaScript application that uses npm for dependency management and the React library for building the user interface. Although the active plaintext file (readme.txt) is empty, in a typical React project you might expect:

JavaScript Code: The application's logic, component definitions, and possibly state management.
npm: A package.json file that lists dependencies (like React and its related libraries), scripts for development and build tasks, and configuration settings.
React: A library for building modular and reusable UI components, where each component typically encapsulates its own structure, style, and behavior.
In summary, the project sets up a modern web development environment with React providing a component-based architecture and npm managing project dependencies and scriptsAwaisAfzal11
